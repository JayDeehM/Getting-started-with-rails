# Getting started with rails

This is a "tutorial" or "practice" on how to use rails as I start to use this for web development.
Basically I'm just started using ruby on rails.

# Usage

1. Before you can run the program, you first have to open the rails server.
  - Open gitbash terminal.
  - Make sure you are in the directory/folder where you placed the files, if not please change your directory.
  - Then type in "$ bin/rails server" or "$ rails s".
  
2. Now that you finished establishing the server type in "http://localhost:3000/articles" in your browser.
  - The program should start to run.
  
3. In this program, you can list articles and keep it in a database.

4. When making a new article, there are some simple requirements that has to be done.
  - Title should consists of atleast 5 characters.
  - There should always be a title.

5. After making the article, it will display the new article.
  - After making the article, you will have the option to go back to the main page or edit the article.
  - You can also leave a comment about the article and also have the freedom to delete comments.

6. As you go back to the main page, It will display the new article. 

7. After making the article, there will be options beside the article.
  - Show => View the article and be able to comment on it.
  - Edit => Edit the article.
  - Destroy => Delete the article including the comments in it.
  
# Conclusion

I just started learning ruby on rails and hoping to be able to learn a lot more and apply it on my projects. 
I will continually do my best to make the program look better and add some feature also as consistent as I can.
